\begin{abstract}
This paper investigates the impact of implementing digital signatures on latency and non-repudiation guarantees in high-frequency banking communications. The objective is to establish a methodological baseline for measuring computational costs, latency variation, and legal security gains.
\end{abstract}

\textbf{Keywords:} digital signatures, latency, non-repudiation, banking systems, high-frequency.

\section{Introduction}
% WRITING ORDER: 3rd - Write after having a clear direction from methodology and initial results
% Write when you understand the full scope of what was investigated
Present the context of high-frequency banking communications, reliability requirements, and the role of digital signatures.

\section{Problem Statement and Hypotheses}
% WRITING ORDER: 2nd - Define early, but refine after methodology is clear
% Helps guide the experimental design
Define the central problem and hypotheses about the trade-off between latency and non-repudiation guarantees.

\section{Objectives}
% WRITING ORDER: 2nd - Define alongside problem and hypotheses
% Sets clear goals before starting experiments
Will implement in Sprint 2 to outline specific objectives related to measuring latency impacts and non-repudiation benefits.

\section{Theoretical Foundation}
% WRITING ORDER: 1st - START HERE to build theoretical foundation
% Research and understand key concepts before designing experiments
Will implement in Sprint 2 to synthesize concepts of digital signatures, network latency, and non-repudiation properties.

\section{Methodology}
% WRITING ORDER: 2nd - Design after understanding fundamentals
% Plan experimental approach before implementation
Will implement in Sprint 3 to detail the experimental design, including test scenarios, control variables, and data collection methods.

\section{Experiment Architecture}
% WRITING ORDER: 3rd - Implement after methodology is defined
% Detail actual implementation and setup
Will implement in Sprint 3 to explain the environment, components, test workloads, and key and certificate configurations.

\section{Metrics and Instrumentation}
% WRITING ORDER: 3rd - Define alongside experiment architecture
% Specify what and how you'll measure
Will implement in Sprint 3 to define metrics (p99, p999, throughput, message size) and collection instruments.

\section{Expected Results}
% WRITING ORDER: 4th - Write after running experiments and collecting data
% Present findings objectively
Will implement in Sprint 4 to indicate expected results and possible patterns of latency degradation.

\section{Threats to Validity}
% WRITING ORDER: 4th - Identify after analyzing results
% Critically assess limitations discovered during experimentation
 Will implement in Sprint 4 to describe evaluation limits, biases, and external factors.

\section{Conclusion}
% WRITING ORDER: 5th (LAST) - Write after everything else is complete
% Synthesize findings and provide closure
Will implement in Sprint 5 to recap the value of the study and propose next steps.
