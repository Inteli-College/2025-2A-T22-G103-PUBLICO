# Chimera VMS - Introduction

## Project Overview

**Chimera VMS** (Vulnerability Management System) is an innovative vulnerability management system that combines automation, artificial intelligence, and continuous monitoring to transform the traditional approach to cybersecurity.

## Identified Problem

Currently, organizations face significant challenges in vulnerability management:

- **Manual Processes**: Manual analysis of vulnerability reports consumes valuable security team time
- **False Positives**: High volume of irrelevant alerts that overwhelm analysts
- **Reactive Response**: Reactive instead of proactive approach to threat identification
- **Lack of Centralization**: Data scattered across different tools and formats

## Proposed Solution

Chimera VMS offers an integrated solution that:

### ðŸ”„ **Complete Automation**
- Automated collection of vulnerability data
- Normalization and structuring of information
- Scheduled execution of security scans

### ðŸ¤– **Artificial Intelligence**
- Machine Learning model for vulnerability classification
- Significant reduction in false positives
- Continuous learning based on feedback

### ðŸ“Š **Intelligent Monitoring**
- Real-time dashboard
- Opsgenie alerts for critical vulnerabilities
- Performance and effectiveness metrics

## Project Objectives

### General Objective
Develop an automated vulnerability management pipeline that transforms the process from manual and reactive to automated and proactive.

### Specific Objectives
- âœ… Automate collection and normalization of vulnerability data
- âœ… Implement intelligent classification system with ML
- âœ… Integrate automatic alerts via Opsgenie
- âœ… Develop visualization and monitoring dashboard
- âœ… Validate effectiveness through quantitative metrics

## Methodology

The project uses agile methodology with **5 sprints** of 2 weeks each:

1. **Sprint 1**: Planning and Preparation
2. **Sprint 2**: Automation and Normalization
3. **Sprint 3**: Structuring and Insertion
4. **Sprint 4**: Intelligence and Integration
5. **Sprint 5**: Visualization and Validation
