# Sprint 1 - Objectives

## Period
**Start Date**: January 15, 2025  
**End Date**: January 29, 2025  
**Duration**: 2 weeks

## Main Objective
Establish the solid foundation of the Chimera VMS project through detailed planning, development environment preparation, and clear definition of technical requirements.

## Specific Objectives

### 1. Planning and Structuring
- [x] Define overall system architecture
- [x] Establish agile development methodology
- [x] Create detailed roadmap for 5 sprints
- [x] Define acceptance criteria for each functionality

### 2. Environment Preparation
- [x] Configure local development environment
- [x] Establish CI/CD pipeline
- [x] Configure versioning tools (Git)
- [x] Prepare testing environment

### 3. Requirements Analysis
- [x] Map vulnerability data sources
- [x] Define database structure
- [x] Specify necessary APIs (Opsgenie, scanners)
- [x] Document main use cases

### 4. Technical Definition
- [x] Choose technology stack
- [x] Define code and documentation standards
- [x] Establish quality metrics
- [x] Configure monitoring tools

## Expected Deliverables

### Documentation
- [x] System Architecture Document
- [x] Functional Requirements Specification
- [x] Test Plan
- [x] Environment Configuration Guide

### Code
- [x] Project base structure
- [x] Dependency configuration
- [x] Initialization scripts
- [x] Basic unit tests

### Infrastructure
- [x] Configured development environment
- [x] Functional CI/CD pipeline
- [x] Structured database
- [x] Basic monitoring implemented

## Success Criteria

### Technical
- ✅ 100% functional development environment
- ✅ CI/CD pipeline running without errors
- ✅ Complete and approved technical documentation
- ✅ Code structure following established standards

### Functional
- ✅ Clearly defined and validated requirements
- ✅ Architecture approved by Product Owner
- ✅ Detailed and feasible sprint schedule
- ✅ Team aligned with objectives and methodology

## Identified Risks

### High Impact
- **Integration Complexity**: APIs from different vendors may have limitations
- **Performance**: Data volume may impact system performance

### Medium Impact
- **Data Availability**: Vulnerability sources may have access limitations
- **Learning**: Learning curve for chosen technologies

### Low Impact
- **Scope Changes**: Possible adjustments during development
- **External Dependencies**: Availability of third-party services

## Next Steps

After completing Sprint 1, the team will be prepared to start Sprint 2, focused on **Automation and Normalization** of vulnerability data.

### Preparation for Sprint 2
- [ ] Review Sprint 1 deliverables
- [ ] Adjust schedule if necessary
- [ ] Prepare environment for automation development
- [ ] Define specific metrics for Sprint 2
