# Theoretical Foundation - Cybersecurity

## 1. Introduction to Cybersecurity

### 1.1 Definition and Fundamental Concepts

**Cybersecurity** is the set of practices, technologies, and processes designed to protect systems, networks, programs, and data against attacks, damage, or unauthorized access. It is a multidisciplinary discipline that combines technical, organizational, and human aspects to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA Triad) of information resources.

### 1.2 The CIA Triad

The fundamental foundation of cybersecurity rests on three essential pillars:

#### **Confidentiality**
- Guarantee that sensitive information is not accessed by unauthorized persons
- Implemented through encryption, access controls, and security policies
- Example: Customer personal data in a bank

#### **Integrity**
- Ensures that information is not altered in an unauthorized manner
- Includes detection of accidental or malicious modifications
- Example: Patient medical records

#### **Availability**
- Ensures that systems and data are accessible when needed
- Protection against denial of service (DoS) attacks
- Example: E-commerce system during Black Friday

### 1.3 Evolution of Cyber Threats

#### **1980s-1990s: Virus Era**
- First computer viruses (Brain, Melissa)
- Attacks focused on damage and skill demonstration
- Low technical sophistication

#### **2000s: Cybercrime Era**
- Financially motivated attacks
- Emergence of botnets and compromised computer networks
- Development of automated attack tools

#### **2010s: APT Era (Advanced Persistent Threats)**
- State-sponsored attacks
- Long-term espionage operations
- Attacks targeting critical infrastructure

#### **2020s: Digital Transformation Era**
- Exponential increase in IoT devices
- Supply chain attacks
- Ransomware as a Service (RaaS)
- Cloud infrastructure attacks

## 2. Security Vulnerabilities

### 2.1 Vulnerability Definition

A **security vulnerability** is a weakness in a system, process, or control that can be exploited by an attacker to compromise security. Vulnerabilities can exist in:

- **Software**: Bugs, design flaws, inadequate configurations
- **Hardware**: Manufacturing defects, backdoors, firmware vulnerabilities
- **Processes**: Inadequate policies, insufficient training
- **People**: Social engineering, negligence, insider threats

### 2.2 Vulnerability Classification

#### **By Severity (CVSS - Common Vulnerability Scoring System)**
- **Critical (9.0-10.0)**: Vulnerabilities that allow remote code execution
- **High (7.0-8.9)**: Vulnerabilities that allow privilege escalation
- **Medium (4.0-6.9)**: Vulnerabilities that allow information disclosure
- **Low (0.1-3.9)**: Vulnerabilities with limited impact

#### **By Attack Type**
- **Injection**: SQL Injection, NoSQL Injection, Command Injection
- **Broken Authentication**: Weak passwords, non-expired sessions
- **Sensitive Data Exposure**: Unencrypted data, logs with sensitive information
- **XML External Entities (XXE)**: Inadequate XML processing
- **Broken Access Control**: Inadequate access controls
- **Security Misconfiguration**: Insecure default configurations
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**: Malicious script injection
- **Insecure Deserialization**: Deserialization of untrusted objects
- **Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities**: Outdated dependencies
- **Insufficient Logging & Monitoring**: Lack of security visibility

### 2.3 Vulnerability Sources

#### **CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures)**
- International system for vulnerability identification
- Each vulnerability receives a unique ID (e.g., CVE-2023-1234)
- Maintained by MITRE Corporation

#### **NVD (National Vulnerability Database)**
- US government database
- Contains detailed information about CVE vulnerabilities
- Includes CVSS scores and references

#### **Vendor Advisories**
- Security advisories from vendors
- Security patches and updates
- Product-specific information

## 3. Vulnerability Management

### 3.1 Vulnerability Management Process

The vulnerability management process is a continuous cycle that includes:

#### **1. Discovery**
- Asset and system identification
- Vulnerability discovery through:
  - Automated scanners
  - Code analysis
  - Penetration testing
  - Bug bounty programs

#### **2. Assessment**
- Impact and probability analysis
- Severity classification
- Risk-based prioritization
- Organizational context analysis

#### **3. Treatment**
- Correction (patching)
- Mitigation (workarounds)
- Risk acceptance
- Risk transfer (insurance)

#### **4. Monitoring**
- Status tracking
- Correction verification
- Trend analysis
- Progress reports

### 3.2 Challenges in Vulnerability Management

#### **Data Volume**
